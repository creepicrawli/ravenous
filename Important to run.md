The Yelp company does not seem to provide an API key outside of the United States anymore.
This means that the results and images from the restaurants will not load.

If you are able to get an API key from Yelp via a VPN or other means, then go to the "Yelp.js" file in "ravenous/src/util/" and insert the API key in the first few lines of code.
